1.It must be a RAG model which can continuesly  train by user prompt and answers.
2. a halograme design need to appier on the screen when is try to genarate or giving responce to user .
3. messages are stored in a json file not in sql db. retrive the last 10 prompt and responces from json file to user ui interface.
4. it can takes input as text or audio . and also user can attach txt files . we need to extract that text from file and train the rag. 
so we can get the similer context about user from rag and give that to llm gemin and got responce based on the user question.
